## 7. Tech Debt & Deferred Items

### Non-Critical Gaps

| Phase | Item | Severity | Impact |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 17-technical-translation-guide | Missing VERIFICATION.md file | Low | Documentation process gap, no user impact |

**Total Tech Debt:** 1 item across 1 phase

### Deferred (Out of Scope)
The following were explicitly deferred per REQUIREMENTS.md:
- DOC-F1: Add troubleshooting guide (v3.0+)
- DOC-F2: Add batch processing documentation (v3.0+)
- DOC-F3: Add configuration file documentation (v3.0+)

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | - | - | - | - |

No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or placeholders found in README documentation.

---

## 9. Verification Evidence

### Test Profiles Used
| Profile | Purpose | Exists |
|---------|---------|--------|
| tests/fixtures/batch_test_data/valid_profiles/profile1.json | Before/after example | ✓ |
| tests/fixtures/batch_test_data/valid_profiles/profile2.json | Mode comparison | ✓ |
| tests/fixtures/batch_test_data/warning_test_profile.json | Warning interpretation | ✓ |

### Code Integration Points
| File | Function | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| src/translate_profile/translator.py:377 | Returns (data, warnings) tuple | ✓ |
| src/translate_profile/cli.py:109-113 | Displays warnings after translation | ✓ |

## 10. Conclusion

Milestone v2.2 has achieved its definition of done:

- ✅ **All 8 requirements satisfied** (DOC-01 through DOC-08)
- ✅ **Phase 17 deliverables complete** (Technical Translation Guide)
- ✅ **Phase 18 verified and passing** (Examples Section)
- ✅ **Cross-phase integration verified** (README → test profiles → CLI → warnings)
- ✅ **All E2E flows functional** (translation, warnings, documentation)

### Recommendation
**Approve milestone completion.** All deliverables are substantive, accurate, and verified. The single tech debt item (missing VERIFICATION.md for Phase 17) is non-blocking and does not affect users.
