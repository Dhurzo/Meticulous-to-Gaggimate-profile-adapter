# Requirements: Espresso Profile Translator

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Users can seamlessly adapt their existing Meticulous extraction profiles for use with Gaggimate machines

## v2.2 Requirements

Documentation update for existing translation system.

### Technical Translation Guide

- [x] **DOC-01**: Update Technical Translation Guide section with exit trigger mappings
  - weight → volumetric conversion with density assumption
  - time → time direct mapping
  - pressure → pressure direct mapping
  - flow → flow direct mapping
  - Include density conversion warning for unusual coffees

- [x] **DOC-02**: Document operator translation mappings
  - >= → gte normalization
  - <= → lte normalization
  - > → gt normalization
  - < → lt normalization
  - Include deprecated operator notices

- [x] **DOC-03**: Document relative-to-absolute trigger conversion
  - Explain +value syntax accumulation algorithm
  - Document error for relative trigger on first phase
  - Include examples of relative → absolute conversion

- [x] **DOC-04**: Document transition mode options
  - SMART mode behavior and when to use
  - PRESERVE mode behavior and when to use
  - LINEAR mode behavior and when to use
  - INSTANT mode behavior and when to use
  - Include mode comparison table

- [x] **DOC-05**: Document warning categories and user guidance
  - Error messages with user-facing explanations
  - Warning messages with practical guidance
  - Info notices for deprecated features

### Examples Section

- [x] **DOC-06**: Add before/after profile example
  - Show real Meticulous JSON input
  - Show translated Gaggimate JSON output
  - Highlight key changes (triggers, operators, transitions)

- [x] **DOC-07**: Add mode selection example
  - Show same profile with different transition modes
  - Explain output differences

- [x] **DOC-08**: Add warning interpretation example
  - Show profile with multiple triggers
  - Show warning output
  - Explain what each warning means and what to do

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Documentation

- **DOC-F1**: Add troubleshooting guide
- **DOC-F2**: Add batch processing documentation
- **DOC-F3**: Add configuration file documentation

### Features (Future)

- Batch processing mode
- Config file support (YAML/TOML)
- Preset profiles for common coffee types

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Interactive TUI | CLI tool, not interactive |
| Profile visualization | Focus on translation, not visualization |
| Bidirectional conversion | One-way translation only |
| Gaggimate → Meticulous | Not a requirement |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DOC-01: Exit trigger mappings | Phase 17 | Complete |
| DOC-02: Operator mappings | Phase 17 | Complete |
| DOC-03: Relative-to-absolute | Phase 17 | Complete |
| DOC-04: Transition modes | Phase 17 | Complete |
| DOC-05: Warning categories | Phase 17 | Complete |
| DOC-06: Before/after example | Phase 18 | Complete |
| DOC-07: Mode selection example | Phase 18 | Complete |
| DOC-08: Warning interpretation | Phase 18 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v2.2 requirements: 8 total
- Mapped to phases: 8
- Unmapped: 0 ✓
- **Shipped: 8/8 ✓**
